The relationship depends on the nature and level of the student and project. An undergrad RA will have far more guidance and frequent meetings than a Master's project. 

At the undergraduate level, the project is the supervisor's project so the supervisor is active/directive and the student is typically responsive and productive.

At the graduate level, the rpoject is the student's project, so the student is active and suggestions direction with the supervisor approving/guiding/redirecting as appropriate.
