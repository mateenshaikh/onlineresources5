    "text": "1.1 Goal\nYour proposal documents that you have done enough research and have the skills to perform the tasks that you are assigning yourself without needing additional help except in rare circumstances. Any possible changes in your plan should be anticipated and the contingency appropriately outlined. You should not have to figure out how to do anything after the proposal is written because you’ve planned well.\nIf you plan things well, you will not spend very much time at the computer coding the project itself. By that, I mean a well-planned proposal should be able to be coded up within a week, perhaps two. You should not have a mindset of diving in and trying things to see what happens, or figuring it out as you go. If you have such plans, then you haven’t actually proposed your project, you’ve proposed a proposal.\nI strongly recommend you think of this as writing a set of background knowledge, and then a concise set of instructions for two other MSc DSc students as their part-time job. Each of these hypothetical students should be able to follow your proposal independently of each other, with no real questions on what to do, and come back to you with the same set of results.\nThe proposal’s literature review will give an overview of the mathematics and algorithms that the student must learn through your document. You should imagine that the student would need to learn the math as much as I require you to learn the math in courses, and would be required to code it all from scratch using no libraries so you are responsible for the mathematical details that will have to go in the final document. This also disqualifies some interesting projects as it can lack a necessary theoretical component. In your lit review, implementation details should focus on what the algorithm does and uses very limited analogies/metaphors unless used as an introduction mechanism. You should not discuss how the functions or libraries work, the parameters you pass, etc..\nIn your methodology, you will explain how your methods in your lit review are implemented and there should be no questions about how something should be done, what process to use, or a decision to make. This means the proposal requires considerable thought to outline for different possible ways the that the project can ultimately go. That may sound like more work, and it is, but the more thought you put into it, the more you will realize which possibilities can actually occur and which ones won’t."

    "text": "1.2 Libraries\nYou are permitted to use any existing library if you could code the whole thing from scratch but you’re choosing not to, to save time. At any point, I should be able to present you with a small version of the data set and you can show me using on paper and a calculator the exact steps and calculations which lead to to the final answer that matches the library as well as corresponding analysis.\nThere are some exceptions to this, such as if an algorithm that’s one small step of your project works faster but gives you the same answer for that one small step as a standard algorithm that you understand. In this case, you may use the faster algorithm without knowing the details. If, however, a major component of your project is to compare how the two algorithms perform, or show that they give different results, then you are responsible for knowing how the faster algorithm works. Similarly, it is unacceptable to simply use a library with default parameters: you should be able to justify why the default parameters are applicable in your scenario.\nAn easy way to to know if you’re doing things at an appropriate level is to assume you’re doing everything with slow/standard algorithms that you understand. If you can complete your proposal and project that way, then you may make substitutions simply to make your project go faster or more accurate. If you cannot make a proposal/project without mentioning the faster or more accurate algorithm (e.g., because the more accurate algorithm is the point of the comparison) then you must understand the more accurate method as that’s a key aspect of your project."

    "text": "1.3 SMART criteria\nIn creating your proposal, you should keep in mind the SMART criteria:\n\nSpecific\nMeasurable\nAchievable (for your time frame/skill/resources)\nRelevant (to our program)\nTimeline\n\nThese are not 5 separate points/sections, but at some point in the proposal each of these things will be addressed and satisfied. Before writing your proposal, I strongly recommend you create a single (run on) sentence which satisfies all of the SMART criteria for your proposal, and then build your proposal from that. It’s very common to put the SMR criteria in the last paragraph of your introduction.\nVery often, at least one of these criteria are violated when the concept of a proposal is rejected or needs more work.\n\n1.3.1 Example\nBad example: This project will determine whether naïve Bayes performs better than a classification tree on large data sets.\nI would respond with things like\n\n“better” defined and measured how? faster computationally? accuracy? f1 score? mean squared error?\nWhat kind of naïve Bayes and what kind of tree? Using greedy optimization like making full trees? If you prune, how much will you know to prune (assuming this isn’t in the methodology). Which distribution will you use and why? Do you have any proof that the defaults in the code are appropriate for your data?\netc..\n\nBetter This project will assess whether naïve Bayes performs better than a classification tree on three commonly used large data sets (data set 1, data set 2, and data set 3). Performance will be measured through mean squared error when employing 10-fold cross validation.\nIn this example, it wasn’t specific or measurable. In your proposal, you should spell out both of these things to the point that the theoretical data science student would not have to think about how to do this, because there is a clear instruction/decision/choice made for this in the proposal.\n\n\n1.3.2 Example\nBad example: This project will create a new machine learning library that will analyze one million incoming emails, and their corresponding responses, to try generating an AI that can automate responses.\nMy biggest issue with this is whether this project can convey knowledge at a Master’s level. Despite being an interesting project, it could be inadequate as the MSc final project if it remains vague about what the theoretical aspect that the student will convey. The second issue I have is how would you know whether the responses are correct?\nBetter: This project will use an existing library to analyze emails to determine which require responses. Of the ones that require responses, the sentiment analysis will analyze incoming emails, and their responses, to try generating an AI that can automate responses.\nIn this example, the project was not achievable, may not have been relevant, and was not measurable.\nAs a side note: I would generally not be involved with this as this is not my area. I can chat with you to help you find a good supervisor that is in this area, though.\n\n\n1.3.3 Example\nBad example: I will conduct further analysis to see which variables should be included to make the best possible model.\nThis is not specific, and therefore, not reproducible, which indirectly means there is no way of knowing if it is actually achievable. There’s no sense of how many sources will be used to look for variables, when to stop looking, how to determine whether the variable “should” be included in the model, etc.. You have to propose how you will do each of these things and leave no doubt for how other hypothetical students would do it, and ensure they will come up with the same answer as someone else who does this proposal.\nBetter: This project will consider the following 11 variables outlined from [reference] as potentially influential in the outcome. Variables will be included by including any variable that remained in the fnial model when performing forward stepwise regression, as outlined in the literature review in section XX, as well LASSO, as outlined in the literature review in section YY. The union of variables that comes out of the final models from either method is included in time series analysis, described below."

    "text": "6.1 Resources\nIf you believe there is a difference in how you write and the quality of writing in technical documents like academic journals, you’ll be expected to change your writing style to match. If you anticipate this is going to be a problem, begin working on this early, such as in your classes for assignments and projects, as well as your seminar reports. These are all excellent opportunities to obtain feedback about your writing (even if there’s not a mark associated it for that particular document). Instructors likely don’t have the time to edit your documents for you, but likely will be happy to give suggestions on how to improve your writing. It is up to the instructor’s discretion on how much (if any) weight to assign to writing quality in courses and seminar. Please do not make the logical fallacy of concluding that a good mark in an assignment (not expressly meant to evaluate your writing quality) implies that level of writing would be appropriate for your final project/thesis. The institution has a writing centre that will help you in improving your writing. I have observed students improve tremendously over several sessions when the session is approached correctly. The writing centre can teach you how to write better, which requires a commitment to learn how to critically appraise your own writing with their guidance to find where you need improvement and fixing your own writing. Treat the staff as educators that can teach you the skills you need to help you write better depending on your particular needs. Do not expect them to be editors that simply fix your writing for you.\nThe one caveat I give is that they become very busy in the winter term when most students are approaching their deadlines. I would strongly suggest that your final project is not when you seek them, but much earlier than that such as during your coursework if you receive feedback that the quality of writing needs improvement.\nIf I suggest from your proposal that you would benefit from the writing centre, I expect you to learn from any feedback I give you, and seriously consider making an appointment with the writing centre to rectify writing issues so that you are not held back a semester."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Proposal format\nAfter several issues, I now require all projects and theses to be written in LaTeX. A not-yet finished example of the proposal is available here.\nYour proposal should have the following document sections\n\n\n1 Introduction\nYour introduction should be (1–2 pages).\n\nIf the main goal is to analyze a particular data set, motivate the context (a few sentences) of how that data is generated and what kind of problem will be solved or what insight you wish to gain from it..\nIf the main goal is to analyze performance (e.g., for comparison) you need to motivate what the method(s) are designed to accomplish, and why there are different methods that exist in the first place.\n\n\n\n2 Data description\n\nIdentify/describe of all variables. You must identify the type of variable. You must also know what each variable is in the context of the problem; it can’t just be just another feature you use to train an algorithm.\nContinuous variables should indicate units\nOrdinal and nominal variables should at least identify the number of levels, and all levels if there are only a few and an example of a few if there are more a - If relevant to the investigation, an approximate distribution of each variable, using an appropriate method of summarizing. This may be extended to correlations\n\n\n\n3 Lit review\nYour background/lit review should be 4+pages.\nThe background/lit review will explain relevant methodological and algorithmic information to follow the next section (proposed methodology for the project/thesis). A bad habit of students is to rely on analogies of what’s being calculated. You must understand and justify all of this. This section is usually the longest section of the proposal for this reason. Most of your citations should be from journals, though some websites and documentation are acceptable.\nMethods should explain what any objective functions are, how optimization occurs, etc.. If a calculation (e.g., the objective function) is not the first, most intuitive calculation the brand new data science student would think of, you must justify why you use something less intuitive/more complicated to solve this problem.\nIf you elect to use a method, you are taking on the responsibility of explaining these choices at the Master’s level. If you can’t answer that, the topic/method is unsuitable for you and you must choose something you can understand and explain. Exceptions to this are rare. Many students underestimate how much they must understand the math behind algorithms to do a project, let alone a thesis.\nWhat you discuss in your lit review should be required for the methodology. One notable exception is if you are doing a thesis and plan to provide an alternative approach to something, it is still worthwhile to explain what your approach is alternative to, here. This is especially important if you’re performing some kind of comparison.\n\n\n4 Methodology\nYour proposed methods section should be 2+ pages.\nAssuming the theoretical new data science student understands the literature review, they should be able to implement the methodology set out in the proposal with ideally no other material necessary. A good lit review will mean the methodology will be very concise, direct, and almost like a checklist of instructions.\nThe methods should include the specific implementation of the algorithm. E.g., a lit review will explain multiple regression with dummy variables, while the methodology will literally write out the equation of the regression variables listing each coefficient for the particular data set. Algorithmic details for your particular data set go here as well such as if you need special initial values for your algorithm, parameters you’ll set in functions, or tuning parameters that you know ahead of time.\nSimulation studies will identify exactly which parameters of the simulation will be investigated, which values will be fixed, and any corresponding assumptions.\nA thesis which develops new methods will have a much longer methodology section because nothing exists to solve the problem at hand, so you propose to develop it in in this section, and the development is part of the instructions to the student. But because this is a proposal, you don’t actually perform the derivations here, you write a skeleton of how you plan to perform the derivation using elements of the lit review.\n\n\n5 Timeline\nTimelines should generally be performed backward. For thesis students, check the official documentation since there are some institutionally-dictated ones. For project students, this is slightly more flexible but the official documentation has the necessary deadlines. Include all of the pertinent deadlines in your proposal.\nDates should be set for the following (put them in chronological order but when you are brainstorming you’ll do this backward):\n\n\n6 Deadlines\nPlan for at least the following deadlines. You will have many more deadlines, however.\n\nNov 15: implementation complete\nJan 15: first complete draft*\nFeb 15: second draft\nMar 15: last day to submit final draft to circulate to committee/second reader\nApr 15: presentation/defence\n\nIn addition to the above, prior to the implementation, you should state your own milestones for the implementation leading to the completion above. I will leave this to you but hold you accountable to it.\n\n\n7 Progress Forms\nBoth project and thesis students will conduct supervisor-only progress reports every 2 months on approximately the following dates\n\nOct 01\nDec 01\nFeb 01\nMar 01\n\nAt these meetings, the supervisor evaluates if the student is making appropriate progress according to the timeline set out in the proposal. While infrequent setbacks can occur, the student is still generally expected to follow the timeline.\nThe results of progress reports are usually one of 3 or 4 categories:\n\nsatisfactory progress\nconcerning progress\nunsatisfactory progress\n\n\n\n8 Additional Thesis meetings\nThe thesis students will have supervisory committee meetings at least once a term. The committee will decide whether it should be the first, second, or third month of each term at the inaugural committee meeting.\n\n\n9 Supervisory Dissolution\nThe student will state as an additional section in their proposal that they agree the thesis or project will be dissolved if any of the following happen:\n\nTwo consecutive progress reports are unacceptable\nThree consecutive progress reports are concerning/unacceptable\nAn academic integrity violation is suspected by the supervisor and suspected by at least one other faculty member.\n\n\n\n10 Outcomes of project\nI like the idea of there being clear expectations of what happens to the final result of the project. If the project is being published (e.g., an R package, or a journal publication) what is the order of authorship, who owns data, etc..\nMy personal approach is that students are first author if they’ve done the writing. If I have to heavily edit or rewrite your thesis to make it acceptable quality for publication, you lose the prestigious status of first-author, which I would have preferred you to have. I also may not have the time or interest to do that so it may simply not be published at all and what could have doubly benefited you has been wasted. This is another reason the quality of writing is important.\nThis section does not have to be in the proposal, but I like it here so that we know it’s officially documented and signed off on."
