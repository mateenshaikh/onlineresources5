    "text": "2.2 Background/Lit review(4+pages)\nThe background/lit review will explain relevent methodological and algorithmic information to follow the next section (proposed methodology for the project/thesis). A bad habit of students is to rely on analogies of what’s being calculated. You must understand and justify all of this. This section is usually the longest section of the proposal for this reason.\nMethods should explain what any objective functions are, how optimization occurs, etc.. If a calculation (e.g., the objective function) is not the first, most intuitive calculation the brand new data science student would think of, you must justify why you use something less intuitive/more complicated to solve this problem.\nIf you elect to use a method, you are taking on the responsibility of explaining these choices at the Master’s level. If you can’t answer that, the topic/method is unsuitable for you and you must choose something you can understand and explain. Exceptions to this are rare. Many students underestimate how much they must understand the math behind algorithms to do a project, let alone a thesis.\nWhat you discuss in your lit review should be required for the methodology. One notable exception is if you are doing a thesis and plan to provide an alternative approach to something, it is still worthwhile to explain what your approach is alternative to, here. This is especially important if you’re performing some kind of comparison."

    "text": "2.3 Methodology (2+ pages)\nAssuming the theoretical new data science student understands the literature review, they should be able to implement the methodology set out in the proposal with ideally no other material necessary. A good lit review will mean the methodology will be very concise, direct, and almost like a checklist of instructions.\nThe methods should include the specific implementation of the algorithm. E.g., a lit review will explain multiple regression with dummy variables, while the methodology will literally write out the equation of the regression variables listing each coefficient for the particular data set. Algorithmic details for your particular data set go here as well such as if you need special initial values for your algorithm, parameteres you’ll set in functions, or tuning parameters that you know ahead of time.\nSimulation studies will identify exactly which parameters of the simulation will be investigated, which values will be fixed, and any corresponding assumptions.\nA thesis which develops new methods will have a much longer methodology section because nothing exists to solve the problem at hand, so you propopose to develop it in in this section, and the development is part of the instructions to the student. But because this is a proposal, you don’t actually perform the derivations here, you write a skeleton of how you plan to perform the derivation using elements of the lit review."
